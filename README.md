# Movie_analytics
In this python project, I am using The TMDB movie dataset freely available on Kaggle. 
The link https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata contains the data for 5000 movies. 
I have downloaded the dataset. It contains two csv files as tmdb_5000_credits.csv and tmdb_5000_movies.csv.

Combine both the datasets together using pandas library in df2.
Convert the dataframe into csv file using to_csv method. 
Now, to create a new csv file containing this data and the poster links of the movies,
use csv library and by comparing the movie names, create a final.csv file.
